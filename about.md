Hello! My name is **Eric Blood**! 

Random things that I like, in no particular order: 
* Acrobatics
* Aerospace
* Aviation -- general aviation, civilian, and military
* Skiing
* Mountain Biking -- though, this is a bit new to me
* Camping and overlanding
* Building out my Nissan Xterra as an overlanding rig
* International travel and adventures
* Self-driving cars -- Did a short stint of that
* Coffee
* Being crazy about life


I'll likely add my resume soon. But not yet. 

Find me at:
