Hello, hello!

Let’s be honest, 2020 sucked. While I’m hopeful that most of you had moments of joy and delight throughout this year, and found ways to prevail in the face of everything happening on this planet, I feel that for most of us, 2020 really sucked. And it’s okay to admit that; life doesn’t have to be peachy all the time. And honestly, I’m super hopeful that 2021 will be a much, much better year, for all of us individually, as well as for the human race globally. It’s not going to happen at the stroke of midnight tonight, but I’m hopeful that the general trend of 2021 is positive, rather than the general trend of 2020.

But all of that aside, there is one thing that I want and need to share.

You are enough.

Period.

Whether or not you felt you were productive this year, or felt accomplished, or calm, or achieved any of your goals -- right now, you are enough. This year was tough beyond imagination for so many of us (and continues to be); wherever you are in your life, it’s enough.

And as much as I am writing these words for you, I am writing them for myself as well. This is something I need to remind myself every day (with varying levels of success).

I hope you all love yourself at least as much as I love you all.

I want to leave you with one final song for the year. Some of you may remember this song from about twenty years ago, but this version of it is, in my opinion, quite delightful:

[Baz Luhrmann - Wear Sunscreen](https://soundcloud.com/zura-papidze/baz-luhrmann-wear-sunscreen-mau-kilaueas-tropical-remix-mp3cutnet?in_system_playlist=personalized-tracks%3A%3Aeblood-1%3A262596649)

With love and coffee and so much hope for the upcoming year,

Eric
