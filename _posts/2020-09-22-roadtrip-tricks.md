I just finished a 6 week roadtrip that meandered from California, through Utah, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and finally, Wisconsin. Though I'm not going to talk about destinations in this post, but rather, tips and tricks to make the roadtrip just a little bit easier. 

For this trip, I camped almost every night, less 3 or 4. Given the current COVID situation, along with my lack of income, camping was the safest and most cost-effective method of traveling. 

I travel in my 2012 Nissan Xterra, affectionally known as Thor. Here are a few things that made the trip just a little more fun. 

# Maps
When traveling, I tended to camp and explore National Parks and National Forests. However, when in those areas, there isn't always reliable cell service. I did the following every time I was entering a National Forest (from an area with really good cell service)
1. Downloaded offline maps for [Google Maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en) 
2. Downloaded offline maps for [GAIA GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/)
3. Look for [National Geographic maps](https://https://www.natgeomaps.com/) for the area

# Finding campgrounds
When heading across country, I did not generally reserve campsites more than 24-48 hours. Most nights, I just looked for first-come campsites. I also tended to avoid National Park campsites, both due to availability and proximity to other people. I used the following to help find campsites:
1. [AllStays Camp and RV App](https://www.allstays.com/apps/camprv.htm) - This app was beyond invaluable. It showed every type of campsite you could imagine: BLM, State Park, National Park, Indepdent, etc. This was used almost every day. 
2. [Hipcamp](https://www.hipcamp.com/) - When I needed to find a site in a more populated area, I looked on Hipcamp. These were generally more expensive, but useful when in a bind. 
3. [BLM Camping](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping) - Bureau of Land Management offers free dispersed camping on nearly all their lands. However, each area may have specific rules, so its worth looking into each one to find out the restrictions. 

# Gas Reserve
When traveling in National Forests, you don't necessarily know where the gas statiosn are, and lately, whether they are open and actually have fuel. For that reason, I recommend doing the following: 
* Always fill up your tank before entering the National Forest
* When your tank drops to 1/2, start looking for your next gas station (this is where having offline maps is extremely useful!)
* Carry a full jerry can of fuel

# Small things that made my camp just a little more comfortable
There were three little things that made my camp just a bit nicer:
1. Little side table for coffee and drinks -- After the first few nights, I realized that it would be super nice to have a mini side table to put drinks on. That afternoon, I stumbled upon a Wood store, which had slices of redwood for sale. I bought one with a few blocks and made a mini side table! Extra, but also, wonderful. 
2. [My desk](https://www.muji.com/in/products/cmdty/detail/4548718499441) -- This sounds a little strange, but I brought with me a small, folding desk. This was, again, invaluable. I used this every night for cooking, writing, putting my feet up, or whatever it needed to be used. My truck isn't big enough to carry a full folding table, so this small table was absolutely perfect. 
3. Hammock. More specifically, this [DoubleNest Hammock](https://www.rei.com/product/754773/eno-doublenest-hammock) from REI (with these [straps](https://www.rei.com/product/159042/eno-atlas-hammock-suspension-system)). I really did not use a hammock much until I picked this one up. 

# Cooler hack! 
In my [cooler](https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/venture-45/cooler/otr56-cooler-45.html), I put three little baskets in the bottom, flipped upside down. This way, as the ice melted, most of the water went below the top of the baskets, and none of my food got soaked in water! There are many ways to keep your food dry from ice-melt; this is just the way I found that I enjoyed. Plus, I'm generally too lazy to put all of my food in separate bags.
