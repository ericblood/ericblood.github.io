I really like sending mail. And I imagine that you like receiving mail! So I'm going to start my first "post" project. Called...

**Delightful Notes through Post!**

How this works: 
1. You send me your address and desire for a delightful note
2. I send you something in the mail! It might be a postcard, a birthday card, a letter, a patch, or just something random. 
3. That's it! There's no step three! 



How to tell me you want a delightful note! 
1. Fill out [this google form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAu-_01kZAT01mIExbgZHbc59i7jb77CCeRYIPGOvHLQcxAw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
2. Send me a message to [my email](mailto:e.blood@gmail.com)

And if you want to share a note with me, you can send it to:
