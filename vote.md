# Voting resources for the 2020 Election

Friends - It it less than 40 days until the end of the US Federal Election period on November 3, 2020. This is almost definitely the most consequential election in your life. Though, sometimes, it feels like your powerless, there are still actions you can take to help save our democracy. Even if you sway one additional person to vote, that will help!! Here are some resources I've compiled on how you can help. 

**Register** If you haven't yet, [register to vote](https://www.vote.org/register-to-vote/) and if you have already registered, [check your registration](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/)!

**Research** Do your research! Not only on the federal elections, but your local and state elections. 

**Vote** And vote early!! And if you are using a mail-in ballot, check the status of your ballot to make sure that it is counted. If you are currently worried about the USPS, many voting districts have drop-off locations for ballots. This is likely the safest way to vote in our current COVID situation. 

**Donate financially** to causes that matter! 
* [Joe Biden and Kamala Harris](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/biden2020_fr_web)
* [Close and flippable senate races](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/getmitch)

**Donate your time**, and help get others registered and ready to vote!
* Write letters with [Vote Forward]( https://votefwd.org/)
* Write letters or phone bank with [Swing Left](https://swingleft.org)
* Phone bank with [NextGen](https://www.mobilize.us/nextgen/event/301653/)
* Phone bank with [Florida Voter Protection](https://www.mobilize.us/flavopro/event/325455/)
* Find other activities at [mobilize.us](https://mobilize.us)  

**Be critical**  Disinformation campaigns on social media will be at an all-time high until November 3. Remeber that not everything you read or see on social media is true. 

**Be emotionally prepared** Even though our part, as citizens, will be over on November 3, this election will likely get drawn out until 2021. This fight is not over until Biden is inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021.
